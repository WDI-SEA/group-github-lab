# Group Github Practice Lab

### Prompt:
You will be building, as a group, an "About Us" page using React and functional components. 

Some examples here: 
1. https://thecorrespondent.com/correspondents
2. https://www.khanacademy.org/about/the-team
3. https://about.twitter.com/en/who-we-are/our-company


This page can be styled however you like, but should at minimum include either an avatar or image to represent each team member, and a quick blurb fact or fiction about them. 

You can divide up the work for your team however you would like, but you will need to appoint one person "main git human"

----
### Getting Started: 
- Appoint a "main git human" who will own the central repository. 
- Have the "main git human" create a new React project locally on their machine using `create-react-app`. 
- Main git human: make a repository for this project on Github. Push your local React project up to Github. 
- Have each team member fork this repository, and then clone to their local machine. 
- Decide who will be building what, and then get to work! Make frequent commits,and then use `git push` to update your forked repo. Make pull requests, and experiment with having the team run `git pull upstream main` to see your teammates work as they progress!

## Tips:

The best way to learn how to handle merge conflicts is to see them come up in real life. 

Keys to handling merge conflicts:
- 99% of the time, if you can auto-merge, just go ahead an do it. This means Github has determined you won't run into any true conflicts, and most of the time Github is correct in this assumption. 
- If you do run into a merge conflict, take your time to read both versions of the code. If one is new, and one is old, most of the time default to the new version (assuming the contributor has tested it). 
- If two users has submitted conflicting code, have a quick conference to determine which solve fits the needs of the project better and based on this consult edit one or both contributions before merging.
